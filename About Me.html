<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mary and I'm a web developer in training! I know what you are thinking oh god another person trying to get into the tech industry.
But bare with me, I've had a career as a surveyor for the past 13+ years, this has seen me work overseas and offshore in numerous countries. During these years I have been
heavily involved in software testing, no not the software testing involved in QA but basically try and break the software and then suggest some changes liasing with software developers and creating proposal documents with the required changes.</p>

<p>Being an offshore surveyor has honed by fault finding skills and attention to detail which I have found are a great assest in this field. Although I am fairly new to the industry I have tried my hand at Java, still fairly basic but I'm slowly getting there. 
I am currently enrolled on a Web Development course and loving it.</p>

<p>This website is my first project and yes I know the styling is non existent and the page is giving off 90's vibes (but we all know we miss the 90's) but in all honestly we have only touched on HTML, after this project we are looking at CSS so bare with me and this 
project will get updated as I move through the course.
